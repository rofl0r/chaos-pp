<overview>
	The <self/> header defines a macro that reverses the elements in a <link id="sequence"/>.
</overview>

<macro id="SEQ_REVERSE" type="indirect" group="reversal">
	<abstract>
		The <SEQ_REVERSE/> macro reverses the elements in its argument.
	</abstract>
	<usage lang="C99">
		<syntax><SEQ_REVERSE/>(seq)</syntax>
		<param id="seq" optional="1">
			The <link id="sequence"/> whose elements are to be reversed.
		</param>
	</usage>
	<usage lang="C/C++">
		<syntax><SEQ_REVERSE/>(seq)</syntax>
		<param id="seq">
			The <link id="sequence"/> whose elements are to be reversed.
		</param>
	</usage>
	<para>
		This macro expands to a <link id="sequence"/> containing the elements of <var>seq</var> in reverse order.
	</para>
	<para>
		This macro uses <link id="sequential iteration"/>.
		As a result, the algorithm is theoretically capable of processing <link id="sequences"/> containing an <em>unrestricted</em> number of elements.
	</para>
	<para>
		The structure of this algorithm causes approximately Θ(<x-var>n</x-var><sup>2</sup>) element scans (where <x-var>n</x-var> is the number of elements in <var>seq</var>).
		This scanning may be inefficient when <var>seq</var> contains a large number of elements.
		In such a situation in C99, it may be more efficient to use <SEQ_REVERSE_DUPLEX/> instead.
		The structure of the <SEQ_REVERSE_DUPLEX/> algorithm causes approximately Θ(<x-var>n</x-var>∙log<sub>2</sub><x-var>n</x-var>) element scans.
		On the other hand, though both <SEQ_REVERSE/> and <SEQ_REVERSE_DUPLEX/> invoke approximately Θ(<x-var>n</x-var>) macros, the discarded constant multiple is significantly larger for <SEQ_REVERSE_DUPLEX/>.
		This causes <SEQ_REVERSE/> to be more efficient when <x-var>n</x-var> is smaller.
		Thus, as <x-var>n</x-var> increases, at some point (depending on the preprocessor) <SEQ_REVERSE_DUPLEX/> is likely to become more efficient.

	<abstract>
		The <SEQ_REVERSE_DUPLEX/> macro reverses the elements in its argument.

		This macro expands to a <link id="sequence"/> containing the elements of <var>seq</var> in reverse order.

	<para>
		The running time of <SEQ_REVERSE_DUPLEX/> can be described in terms of the number of <link id="recursion steps"/> required to complete the algorithm.

	<para>
		As with <SEQ_REVERSE/>, the structure of this algorithm causes the invocation of approximately Θ(<x-var>n</x-var>) macros (where <x-var>n</x-var> is the number of elements in <var>seq</var>).
		However, the discarded constant multiple is significantly larger.
		This macro expansion may be inefficient when <var>seq</var> contains a small number of elements.
		In such a situation, it is more efficient to use <SEQ_REVERSE/> instead.
		On the other hand, the structure of the <SEQ_REVERSE/> algorithm causes approximately Θ(<x-var>n</x-var><sup>2</sup>) element scans.
		The structure of the <SEQ_REVERSE_DUPLEX/> algorithm causes approximately Θ(<x-var>n</x-var>∙log<sub>2</sub><x-var>n</x-var>) element scans.
		Thus, as <x-var>n</x-var> increases, at some point (depending on the preprocessor) <SEQ_REVERSE_DUPLEX/> is likely to become more efficient.
	</para>
	<para>
		This macro uses <link id="bypass semantics"/>.
		If <link id="bypass semantics"/> are already in effect, <SEQ_REVERSE_DUPLEX_BYPASS/> must be used instead.
