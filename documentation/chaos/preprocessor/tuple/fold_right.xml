<overview>
	The <self/> header defines an algorithm that accumulates the elements of a <link id="tuple"/> from the last element to the first element.
</overview>

<macro id="TUPLE_FOLD_RIGHT" type="indirect" group="right-accumulation">
	<abstract>
		The <TUPLE_FOLD_RIGHT/> macro accumulates the elements of its second argument with the operation specified by its first argument.
	</abstract>
	<usage lang="C99">
		<syntax><EXPR/>(<TUPLE_FOLD_RIGHT/>(op, tuple, ...))</syntax>
		<param id="op">
			<para>
				The operation that is to be used to accumulate the elements of <var>tuple</var>.
				This operation must be either a <link id="λ expression"/> or a macro name that refers to a macro with a signature compatible with the following pseudo-signature:
				<snippet>
					op(s, elem, state<sup>†</sup>)
				</snippet>
			</para>
			<para>
				<sup>†</sup>
				The <var>state</var> pseudo-parameter must be either <code>...</code> or the number of parameters that corresponds to the number of arguments in the accumulation state, <code>__VA_ARGS__</code>.
			</para>
		</param>
		<param id="tuple" optional="1">
			The <link id="tuple"/> whose elements are to be accumulated.
		</param>
		<param id="..." optional="1">
			The initial state of the accumulation.
		</param>
	</usage>
	<para>
		The <TUPLE_FOLD_RIGHT/> macro itself expands to a <link id="deferred expression"/> in terms of <code><NEXT/>(s)</code>.
		This <link id="deferred expression"/>, when invoked by <EXPR/>, expands to the result of accumulating the elements of <var>tuple</var>, from right to left, with the user-specified operation.
		This is illustrated by the following pseudo-code:
		<snippet>
			op(s, tuple[0], op(s, tuple[1], ... op(s, tuple[length(tuple) - 1], state) ... ))
		</snippet>
	</para>
	<para>
		An invocation of the operation with the current <link id="recursion state"/> (<var>s</var>), a particular element (<var>elem</var>), and the current state (<code>__VA_ARGS__</code>) expands to a new state used in the accumulation of subsequent elements (or as the final result of the algorithm if no further elements exist).
		The operation may also expand to a <link id="deferred expression"/> in terms of <code><NEXT/>(s)</code> that expands to a new state.
		Expansion to a <link id="deferred expression"/> allows the operation to recurse on itself if necessary.
	</para>
	<para>
		Invocations of the operation are trampolined such that each invocation is invoked with <code><NEXT/>(<NEXT/>(s))</code>, where <var>s</var> is the original <link id="recursion state"/> at the beginning of the algorithm (i.e. <code><STATE/>()</code>).
		This maximizes the utility of the <link id="recursion backend"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
		Ignoring the complexity of <var>op</var> (which is invoked once for each element in <var>tuple</var>), the efficiency of the algorithm's use of the <link id="recursion backend"/> can be described in terms of the number of <link id="recursion steps"/> required to complete the algorithm.
		The asymptotic upper and lower bounds are <assoc id="complexity/fold_right.gif">Θ</assoc>, where <x-var>n</x-var> is the number of elements in <var>tuple</var>.
	</para>
	<para>
		This macro operates on the nil <link id="tuple"/> representation used by the core <link id="tuple"/> operations defined in <chaos-preprocessor-tuple-core.h/>.
		Specifically, <code>()</code> is a one-element <link id="tuple"/>, not a zero-element <link id="tuple"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
		This macro deduces the current <link id="recursion state"/> and invokes <TUPLE_FOLD_RIGHT_S/>.
		If the current <link id="recursion state"/> is already known, direct use of <TUPLE_FOLD_RIGHT_S/> is more efficient.
	</para>
	<para>
		This macro may not be used if <link id="bypass semantics"/> are in effect.
