<overview>
	The <self/> header defines an algorithm that accumulates the elements of a <link id="generic data structure"/> from the last element to the first element.
</overview>

<macro id="FOLD_RIGHT_AUX" type="indirect" group="right-accumulation">
	<abstract>
		The <FOLD_RIGHT_AUX/> macro accumulates the elements of its second argument with the operation specified by its first argument.

		<param id="op">
			<para>
				The operation that is to be used to accumulate the elements of <var>g</var>.
				This operation must be either a <link id="λ expression"/> or a macro name that refers to a macro with a signature compatible with the following pseudo-signature:

					op(s, elem<sup>1</sup>, data<sup>2</sup>, state<sup>3</sup>)

			</para>
			<para>
				<sup>1</sup>
				If the type of <var>g</var> is non-variadic, <var>elem</var> must be the number of parameters that corresponds to the number of sub-elements in each element of <var>g</var>.
				Otherwise, <var>elem</var> must be a single parameter.
			</para>
			<para>
				<sup>2</sup>
				If the auxiliary data is parenthetic, the <var>data</var> pseudo-parameter must be the number of parameters that corresponds to the number of sub-elements in the auxiliary data.
				Otherwise, it must be a single parameter.

			<para>

				The <var>state</var> pseudo-parameter must be either <code>...</code> or the number of parameters that corresponds to the number of arguments in the initial state, <code>__VA_ARGS__</code>.

		<syntax><EXPR/>(<FOLD_RIGHT_AUX/>(op, g, data, state))</syntax>
		<param id="op">
			The operation that is to be used to accumulate the elements of <var>g</var>.

	<para>
		The <FOLD_RIGHT_AUX/> macro itself expands to a <link id="deferred expression"/> in terms of <code><NEXT/>(s)</code>.
		This <link id="deferred expression"/>, when invoked by <EXPR/>, expands to the result of accumulating the elements of <var>g</var>, from right to left, with the user-specified operation.
		This is illustrated by the following pseudo-code:
		<snippet>
			op(s, g[0], data, op(s, g[1], data, ... op(s, g[length(g) - 1], data, state) ... ))
		</snippet>
	</para>
	<para>
		An invocation of the operation with the current <link id="recursion state"/> (<var>s</var>), a particular element (<var>elem</var>), the auxiliary data (<var>data</var>), and the current state (<var>state</var> or <code>__VA_ARGS__</code>) expands to a new state used in the accumulation of subsequent elements (or as the final result of the algorithm if no further elements exist).
		This operation may also expand to a <link id="deferred expression"/> in terms of <code><NEXT/>(s)</code> that expands to a new state.
		Expansion to a <link id="deferred expression"/> allows the operation to recurse on itself if necessary.
	</para>
	<para>
		Invocations of the operation are trampolined such that each invocation is invoked with <code><NEXT/>(<NEXT/>(s))</code>, where <var>s</var> is the original <link id="recursion state"/> at the beginning of the algorithm (i.e. <code><STATE/>()</code>).
		This maximizes the utility of the <link id="recursion backend"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
		The auxiliary data, <var>data</var>, is treated differently depending on whether it is parenthetic.
		If <var>data</var> is non-parenthetic, it is passed directly to the operation as a single argument.
		In C99, if <var>data</var> is a parenthetic expression of any arity, its sub-elements are passed to the operation as individual arguments.
		In C (prior to C99) and C++, if <var>data</var> is a unary parenthetic expression, its sub-element is passed to the operation as a single argument (a parenthetic expression of any other arity is prohibited).
	</para>
	<para>
		Ignoring the complexity of <var>op</var> (which is invoked once for each element in <var>g</var>), the running time of <FOLD_RIGHT_AUX/> can be described in terms of the number of <link id="recursion steps"/> required to complete the algorithm.
		The asymptotic upper and lower bounds are Θ(<x-var>n</x-var>+1), where <x-var>n</x-var> is the number of elements in <var>g</var>.
	</para>
	<para>
		This macro deduces the current <link id="recursion state"/> and invokes <FOLD_RIGHT_AUX_S/>.
		If the current <link id="recursion state"/> is already known, direct use of <FOLD_RIGHT_AUX_S/> is more efficient.
	</para>
	<para>
		This macro may not be used if <link id="bypass semantics"/> are in effect.
