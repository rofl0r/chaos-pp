	<para>
		The <DELINEATE_FROM_TO/> macro itself expands to a <link id="deferred expression"/> in terms of <code><NEXT/>(s)</code>.
		This <link id="deferred expression"/>, when invoked by <EXPR/>, expands to the result of repeating the target for each number ranging from <var>from</var> to <var>to</var> - 1 (with the delineator specified by <var>sep</var> between each repetition).
		This is illustrated by the following pseudo-code:
		<snippet>
			macro(s, from, data) sep()
			    macro(s, from + 1, data) sep()
			        ...
			            macro(s, to - 1, data)
		</snippet>
	</para>
	<para>
		The target is invoked for each number in the half-open range [<var>from</var>, <var>to</var>) with the current <link id="recursion state"/> (<var>s</var>), the current repetition (<var>n</var>), and, if it exists, the auxiliary data (<var>data</var> or <code>__VA_ARGS__</code>).
		This target may expand to a <link id="deferred expression"/> in terms of <code><NEXT/>(s)</code>.
		This allows the target to recurse on itself if necessary.
	</para>
	<para>
		In C99, it is possible to omit the auxiliary data argument altogether.
		This is different than passing "nothing" as the auxiliary data.
		<snippet>
			<EXPR/>(
			    <DELINEATE_FROM_TO/>(0, 10, SEP, MACRO,) // #1
			    <DELINEATE_FROM_TO/>(0, 10, SEP, MACRO)  // #2
			)
		</snippet>
		The first line passes "nothing" as the auxiliary data, which causes <code>MACRO</code> to be invoked as (e.g.)...
		<snippet>MACRO(s, 0,)</snippet>
		The second line omits the auxiliary data, which causes <code>MACRO</code> to be invoked as (e.g.)...
		<snippet>MACRO(s, 0)</snippet>
		The fundamental difference is that, in the first line, the auxiliary data is empty (which might have a valid meaning as data), but, in the second line, <em>there is not auxiliary data</em>.
		Hence, the algorithm is overloaded on a <link id="true-optional parameter"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
		Invocations of the target are trampolined such that each invocation is invoked with <code><NEXT/>(s)</code>, where <var>s</var> is the original <link id="recursion state"/> at the beginning of the algorithm (i.e. <code><STATE/>()</code>).
		This maximizes the utility of the <link id="recursion backend"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
		Ignoring the complexity of <var>macro</var> (which is invoked exactly <var>to</var> - <var>from</var> times), the running time of <DELINEATE_FROM_TO/> can be described in terms of the number of <link id="recursion steps"/> required to complete the algorithm.
		The asymptotic upper and lower bounds are Θ(<x-var>t</x-var>-<x-var>f</x-var>+1), where <x-var>t</x-var> is <var>to</var> and <x-var>f</x-var> is <var>from</var>.
	</para>
	<para>
		An invocation of the delineator, <var>sep</var>, is placed between each invocation of the target.
		This is a nullary invocation that is not intended to be complex--it is prohibited from using the <link id="recursion backend"/>.
		Typically, the <var>sep</var> argument is <EMPTY/> (which makes the function of this macro identical to <REPEAT_FROM_TO/>), <COMMA/> (which makes the function of this macro identical to <ENUM_FROM_TO/>), or a use of <IDENTITY/> for nearly everything else.
		It is also possible, though uncommon, to use <LPAREN/>, <RPAREN/>, or some other nullary macro.
	</para>
	<para>
		This macro deduces the current <link id="recursion state"/> and invokes <DELINEATE_FROM_TO_S/>.
		If the current <link id="recursion state"/> is already known, direct use of <DELINEATE_FROM_TO_S/> is more efficient.
	</para>
	<para>
		This macro may not be used if <link id="bypass semantics"/> are in effect.
